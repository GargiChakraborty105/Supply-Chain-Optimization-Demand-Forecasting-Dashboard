How to Use the Inputs in the Supply Chain Optimization & Demand Forecasting Dashboard
1. Product Selection
Input: Product_ID
This dropdown lets you select a specific product from the dataset.
Each product will have unique demand forecasts, inventory levels, supply chain disruptions, and "what-if" scenarios based on its historical data.
2. Forecast Period
Input: forecast_days
A slider to select how many days ahead you want to forecast demand (between 7 and 30 days).
The forecast model predicts future demand using a 7-day moving average and adds variability for each future date.
3. Inventory Recommendations
Inputs:
Inventory_Level: Current inventory level for the selected product.

Reorder_Threshold: Minimum inventory level before a reorder is recommended.

Logic:

If Inventory_Level < Reorder_Threshold: A warning message is displayed to recommend restocking.
Otherwise, a success message is shown indicating inventory is sufficient.
4. Supply Chain Disruptions
Inputs:
Lead_Time: The estimated time (in days) for suppliers to deliver new stock.

Supplier_Reliability: Percentage representing the supplier's reliability.

Logic:

Higher Lead_Time and lower Supplier_Reliability increase the risk of disruptions.
The dashboard can highlight potential delays based on these values, helping plan alternative suppliers or buffer stocks.
5. What-If Scenario Analysis
Inputs:
forecast_days, Inventory_Level, Lead_Time, and Supplier_Reliability.

Usage:

Simulate real-time scenarios by adjusting these inputs to see how forecasts, inventory needs, and potential disruptions change.
For example:
Increase Lead_Time to see how delays affect inventory recommendations.
Decrease Supplier_Reliability to understand disruption risks.
How to Integrate and Run the Dashboard
Data Preparation:

Ensure the dataset (supply_chain_updated_data.csv) includes the following columns:
Date
Product_ID
Units_Sold
Sales_Price
Inventory_Level
Reorder_Threshold
Lead_Time
Supplier_Reliability


Run the Streamlit App:

In your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the project directory.
Run the following command:

streamlit run supply_chain.py

Interact with the Dashboard:

Use the sidebar to select different products and forecast periods.
Review demand forecasts, inventory recommendations, potential disruptions, and real-time scenario analysis.
